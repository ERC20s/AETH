Polkadot substrate integration and education.


Dear DCL family.
I've been building an educational platform to teach dcl users about the polkadot ecosystem:
https://play.decentraland.org/?position=95%2C122&realm=dg&island=I14iy1

There are over 30 parachains on polkadot. Each with their own tools, dapps, communities, founders, developers and financial ecosystems.

I want to build a series of hackathons to further integrate polkadot into decentraland.

LET'S BUIDL!


Decentraland <> Polkadot
What do I want to build?

How this benefits Decentraland?
DCL should receive more attention from polkadot community resulting in more active users and more tools being built for decentraland. And with new developers entering the space the posibilities are endless as we know..

Later this month I will be doing an event for talisman.xyz to showcase what they have built.
(A metamask alternative that can be used to log in to decentraland and can access polkadot and ethereum data at the same time..)

So how do we benefit?
Polkadot has over 15,000 developers

Who?
Butter#4840 - Been doing events on my own since May 2020. With the most notable being Keep Networks hackathon in Dec 2020 which received 2.2m views from 50,000 unique addresses.. Since then I've been doing events for individual companies and projects. I've recently hired 2 guys to help build my vision.
Binh - WSS/Backend stuff. Can build anything.
Max - Graphic designer recently aquired. 

What we have built so far?
UNO (Which I will opensource)
A system for inputting quiz answers..
A system for approving questions/answers..
A game for viewing quiz answers..

Motive:
Over the last year I have developed good relationships with a lot of polkadot/kusama brands. But with a new ecosystem being added every week it is becoming hard to keep up with all the activity. So I want to bring them all together in decentraland.


The style is in a quiz format where project owners can submit questions for users to answer with the reward of an NFT.











Decentraland <> Polkadot
A symbiotic relationship that benefits both parties.
Decentraland will be gifted with tools such as talisman.xyz.
(A metamask alternative that can be used to log in to decentraland but can access polkadot and ethereum data at the same time..
So how do I think we can be involved?
A few ways. 

So how will this benefit decentraland?
I want to bring them all into the decentraland ecosystem by providing them with

Current work

Decentraland does not currently benefit from the polkadot ecosystem.

Decentraland <> Polkadot
A symbiotic partnership that benefits both parties.
DCL should receive more active users in-game and more items being added to
Decentraland repositories.
More integration of existing tools such as talisman.xyz

So currently me and my colleague have built:

A system for inputting quiz answers..
A way of approving quiz answers..
A game for viewing quiz answers..

Motive:
Over the last year I have developed good relationships with a lot of polkadot/kusama brands. Recently there has been an increase in developer adoption that has made it very hard to keep up with all the activity

So how will this benefit decentraland?

So how do we benefit?
Polkadot has over 15,000 developers and most are unaware of decentraland and uneducated about our metaverse!
